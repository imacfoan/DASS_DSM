Section 8: Case Study and Formative Assessment
:::

This section is comprised of a demonstration on utilising ChatGPT for
data science projects developed by Dr. Tatjana Kecojevic, Lecturer in
Social Statistics.

**Leveraging ChatGPT for Enhanced Data Science Projects**

Engaging with [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) during data science
projects in R offers a versatile and innovative approach to
problem-solving and project management. As an AI-powered assistant,
ChatGPT efficiently addresses complex challenges at various stages of
the project lifecycle, serving as a reliable resource for guidance on
best practices, educational insights, and time-saving solutions. By
providing instant responses and suggestions, ChatGPT streamlines data
preprocessing, model selection, and result interpretation, enabling
users to focus more on analysis and decision-making.

ChatGPTâ€™s comprehensive support spans data visualization, statistical
analysis, machine learning model building, and beyond, making it an
invaluable asset for both novice and experienced data scientists. Its
innovative approach encourages experimentation and exploration,
fostering creativity and pushing the boundaries of traditional data
analysis methodologies. Integrating ChatGPT into data science projects
in R not only enhances efficiency but also promotes continuous learning
and innovation in the field.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to utilise ChatGPT for an end-to-end
data science project. We will use various prompts to create a project
outline, write R code, conduct research, and debug applications.
Additionally, we will provide tips on crafting effective ChatGPT
prompts.

The focus of this tutorial is a single AI project suitable for
intermediate practitioners. This project builds on foundational skills
and is designed to be both challenging and engaging, offering a
practical way to enhance your abilities. You will learn how to handle
datasets, build and train models, and evaluate their performance,
providing a comprehensive understanding of the AI project lifecycle. For
this, we will use the [Spanish Wine Quality
Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/spanish-wine-quality-dataset?resource=download)
available from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
