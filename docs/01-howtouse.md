::: attention
**1:** Before beginning, it is recommended that you create a RStudio project for this course and work through the exercises and tasks in each section using this project. 

**2:** You should **write** and **save** your answers to the exercises and tasks in R scripts. You should have at least one R script for each course unit section. 

**3:** To adequately develop your practical programming skills, it is absolutely **essential** that you first attempt all exercises and tasks in each section on your own before comparing your answers with those provided in this notebook. Type out the code, run it in the console, and save all the code in an R script.
