A business consultancy firm is compiling a major report about
globalisation. One aspect of this study concerns the determinants of FDI
undertaken by multi-national enterprises. Relevant information from a
sample of 60 multi-national companies that undertook significant
investment in overseas projects was made available as follows:

This is a multiple regression type of the problem; FDI is the key
response variable as this study concerns the determinants of FDI
undertaken by multi-national enterprises.

The model is defined as $Y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + ... + b_kx_k + e$,
for the general $k$ explanatory variable model and where e is also known
as the error term $e ∼ N(0,\sigma^2)$, with the error term from a normal
distribution with a mean of $0$, and a variance of $\sigma^2$.

Based on prior knowledge, we make the assumption that GDP_Cap, Gr_rate,
ROC, Infra, and Trade have positive relationships with FDI, whilst
Stable has a negative relationship with FDI.

We will use our best fit model to predict FDI for the following information:  *country X receiving the investment has GDP per capita of 11.1 and Gr_rate per capita of 3.05; The average return on capital invested is 20.5%; There were 11 changes of government over the past 25 years and country X has good infrastructure with some restrictions on trade.*

First, let's load the required packages: 


```r
library(tidyverse)
# you should have already installed this package as part of the previous Demonstration
library(GGally)
```

Let's import the data into R.


```r
mydataq1 <- read.csv("data/FDI.csv", header = T) 
```

Now let's get a glimpse of the data. As you know, there are many ways to
do that, such as, for example, using the tidyverse `glimpse` function.
This is quite a handy function because it also tells us more about the
class of each variable. We can see that although **Infra** and **Trade**
categorical, these are coded as integers.


```r
glimpse(mydataq1)
```

```
## Rows: 60
## Columns: 7
## $ FDI     <dbl> 184.00, 187.00, 186.00, 192.00, 188.00, 190.00, 193.00, 194.00…
## $ GDP_Cap <dbl> 4.4, 6.3, 5.3, 5.9, 9.4, 7.6, 8.7, 6.0, 8.4, 10.1, 8.0, 6.9, 7…
## $ Gr_rate <dbl> 2.54, 4.06, 3.79, 3.38, 1.54, 2.25, 3.01, 2.13, 2.18, 3.33, 2.…
## $ ROC     <dbl> 6.7, 9.3, 7.1, 3.9, 6.3, 9.3, 6.3, 9.7, 5.6, 17.1, 9.1, 15.2, …
## $ Stable  <int> 9, 8, 11, 11, 8, 9, 9, 11, 12, 12, 8, 7, 12, 9, 8, 5, 9, 7, 11…
## $ Infra   <int> 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,…
## $ Trade   <int> 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3,…
```

We therefore need to transform them into factors.


```r
mydataq1 <- mydataq1 %>%
  mutate(Infra = as_factor(Infra),
         Trade = as_factor(Trade)
         )
```

We can then explore all variables in the dataset as pairs using a matrix
of plots. Among many interesting features, we can note quite strong
correlations among pairs of variables which suggest the presence of
multicollinearity: GDP_Cap and ROC, Infra and GDP_Cap, Infra and ROC,
and Infra and Gr_rate.


```r
GGally::ggpairs(mydataq1)
```

<img src="05-S05-P2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" />

Ok, so our initial model is:

$FDI = b_0 + b_1GDP\_Cap + b_2Gr\_rate + b_3ROC – b_4Stable + b_5Infra + b_6Trade + e$

where **Infra** and **Stable** are dummy variables.

We can have a look at how these two dummy variables are used in the
model by using the `contrasts()` function from base R.

The **Infra** variable is coded as *1 = basic infrastructure* and *2 =
good infrastructure*. Since this is a binary variable, there will be one
reference category and a single dummy variable.


```r
contrasts(mydataq1$Infra)
```

```
##   2
## 1 0
## 2 1
```

The **Trade** variable is coded as *1 = trade tightly* and *2 = some
restrictions on trade* and *2 = some restrictions on trade*. Since this
is variable with three categories, there will be one reference category
and two dummy variables.


```r
contrasts(mydataq1$Trade)
```

```
##   2 3
## 1 0 0
## 2 1 0
## 3 0 1
```

Let's now fit our multiple regression model.


```r
m1 <- lm(FDI ~ GDP_Cap + Gr_rate + ROC + Stable + Infra + Trade, data = mydataq1)
```

And explore the results.


```r
summary(m1)
```
