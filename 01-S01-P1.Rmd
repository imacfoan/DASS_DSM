# Practical 1 {.unnumbered}

::: file
For the tasks below, you will require the **College** dataset from the
core textbook (James et. al 2021).

Remember to place your data file in a separate subfolder within your R project working directory.
:::

The **College** dataset contains statistics for a large number of US Colleges from the 1995 issue of US News and World Report. It is a data frame with 777 observations and 18 variables. The variables are:

-   Private : Public/private indicator
-   Apps : Number of applications received
-   Accept : Number of applicants accepted
-   Enroll : Number of new students enrolled
-   Top10perc : New students from top 10% of high school class
-   Top25perc : New students from top 25% of high school class
-   F.Undergrad : Number of full-time undergraduates
-   P.Undergrad : Number of part-time undergraduates
-   Outstate : Out-of-state tuition
-   Room.Board : Room and board costs
-   Books : Estimated book costs
-   Personal : Estimated personal spending
-   PhD : Percent of faculty with Ph.D.â€™s
-   Terminal : Percent of faculty with terminal degree
-   S.F.Ratio: Student/faculty ratio
-   perc.alumni : Percent of alumni who donate
-   Expend : Instructional expenditure per student
-   Grad.Rate : Graduation rate

### Task 1 {.unnumbered}

Import the dataset in an object called **college** using the tidyverse `read_csv()` function.

If you then have a look at the contents of the data object using `View()`,
you will notice that the first column contains the names of all of the
universities in the dataset. You will also notice that it has a strange
name.

Actually, these data should not be treated as a variable (column) since
it is just a list of university names.

### Task 2 {.unnumbered}

Keeping the list of names in the data object, transform this column such
that the university names in the column become row names. Hint: use the
`column_to_rownames()` function from `dplyr`.

::: question
How would have your approach to this task differed if you would have
imported the dataset using base R? Try it!
:::

### Task 3 {.unnumbered}

Produce summary statistics for all variables in the data object.

### Task 4 {.unnumbered}

Create a scatterplot matrix of the first three numeric variables.

### Task 5 {.unnumbered}

Produce side by side box plots of `Outstate` versus `Private` using base
R.

::: question
Did this work? Why?
:::

### Task 6 {.unnumbered}

Using the `Top10perc` variable, create a new categorical variable called
`Elite` such that universities are divided into two groups based on
whether or not the proportion of students coming from the top 10% of
their high school classes exceeds 50%. Hint: use a combination of
`mutate()` and `if_else()`.

### Task 7 {.unnumbered}

Produce side by side box plots of the new `Elite` variable and
`Outstate`.

::: question
How would you produce a similar plot using base R?
:::

### Task 8 {.unnumbered}

Use base R to produce a multipanel plot that displays histograms of the
following variables: `Apps`, `perc.alumni`, `S.F.Ratio`, `Expend`. Hint:
use `par(mfrow=c(2,2))` to set up a 2x2 panel. Try to adjust the
specifications (e.g. breaks).

### Task 9 {.unnumbered}

Using `Accept` and `Apps`, create a new variable that describes
acceptance rate. Name this variable `acceptance_rate`. Hint: use
`mutate()`.

### Task 10 {.unnumbered}

Using the `acceptance_rate` variable, find out which university has the
lowest acceptance rate. Hint: for a `tidyverse` approach, you can use
`slice_min()`.

### Task 11 {.unnumbered}

Using the `acceptance_rate` variable, find out which university has the
highest acceptance rate.
